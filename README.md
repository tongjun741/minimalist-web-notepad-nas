# Minimalist Web Notepad

This is an open source clone of notepad.cc, which is now defunct.

See demo at https://notes.orga.cat or https://notes.orga.cat/whatever.

A version that allows for optional encryption using the Web Crypto API is available at the [encryption](https://github.com/pereorga/minimalist-web-notepad/tree/encryption) branch.

## Installation

At the top of `index.php` file, change `$base_url` variable to point to your
site.

Make sure the web server is allowed to write to the `_tmp` directory.

### On Apache

You may need to enable mod_rewrite and set up `.htaccess` files in your site configuration.
See [How To Set Up mod_rewrite for Apache](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-mod_rewrite-for-apache-on-ubuntu-14-04).

### On Nginx

To enable URL rewriting, put something like this in your configuration file:

If notepad is in the root directory:
```
location / {
    rewrite ^/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ /index.php?note=$1;
}
```

If notepad is in a subdirectory:
```
location ~* ^/notes/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ {
    try_files $uri /notes/index.php?note=$1;
}
```

### Docker

Build the container:
```
docker build -t minimalist-web-notepad .
```

Start the container:
```
docker run -d --name minimalist-web-notepad -p 80:80 minimalist-web-notepad
```

Show logs:
```
docker logs -f minimalist-web-notepad
```

Stop the container:
```
docker stop minimalist-web-notepad
```

Alternatively, docker-compose can also be used:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
and
```
docker-compose down
```

#### Environment variables

`MWN_BASE_URL`    The base URL for redirection and assets. Defaults to ''.

`MWN_SAVE_PATH`   The path to save the notes to. Relative paths are relative to `index.php` location.
